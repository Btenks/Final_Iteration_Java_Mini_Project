Java Login and Signup Application
Overview
This is a simple Java Swing-based Login and Signup Application that provides a user-friendly interface for new users to register and existing users to log in. The app demonstrates fundamental concepts of Graphical User Interface (GUI) development using Java Swing, event handling, and basic validation. The app features two windows:

Signup Page: Allows users to create a new account.
Login Page: Authenticates users based on credentials entered during signup.
The project follows secure coding practices, minimalistic design, and provides an intuitive flow from Signup to Login. This application serves as a foundational template for more complex projects that require user authentication and session handling.

Features
Signup Page:

Users can create an account with a username and password.
Cancel button on the Signup page redirects users to the Login page.
Validation checks ensure that usernames and passwords are not left empty.
Elegant color scheme and layout to enhance user experience.
Login Page:

Users can log in with their registered username and password.
On successful login, a Welcome Window displays the userâ€™s full name and registration number.
Incorrect credentials trigger an error message prompting the user to try again.
Elegant Design and Color Scheme:

Both the Signup and Login forms use cool, modern colors to create a professional look and feel.
Grid-based layout ensures clean and responsive alignment of elements.
Design Considerations
Separation of Concerns:

The project is modular, with separate windows for Signup and Login, ensuring maintainability and readability.
Security:

Passwords are handled using JPasswordField to mask input.
Placeholder validation ensures that fields are not left empty.
Navigation Flow:

Users can smoothly navigate between Signup and Login forms using appropriate buttons (e.g., Cancel button redirects to Login page).
Error Handling:

Clear feedback messages notify users when login fails, improving user experience.
